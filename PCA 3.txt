
Q1: 

For a square matrix 
A, if 𝐴𝑣=𝜆𝑣
Av=λv, where 𝑣
v is a non-zero vector, then:
v is an eigenvector of 𝐴𝜆
λ is the corresponding eigenvalue.
Relation to Eigen-Decomposition:
Eigen-decomposition expresses 
𝐴 as 𝐴=𝑉Λ𝑉−1
A=VΛV −1, where:
V is the matrix of eigenvectors.
Λ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.


Q2: What Is Eigen-Decomposition and Its Significance in Linear Algebra?
Eigen-Decomposition:
The process of decomposing a square matrix 
A into 𝐴=𝑉Λ𝑉−1
A=VΛV−1
, where 𝑉
V contains eigenvectors, and 
Λ contains eigenvalues.
Significance:
Simplifies matrix operations like raising 
𝐴
A to a power.
Provides insights into the matrix's structure, such as rotation, scaling, and shear transformations.
Forms the foundation for techniques like PCA, spectral clustering, and linear transformations.

Q3: Conditions for a Matrix to Be Diagonalizable Using Eigen-Decomposition
Condition:
A square matrix 
𝐴
A is diagonalizable if it has 
𝑛
n linearly independent eigenvectors, where 
𝑛
n is the size of the matrix.

Proof Outline:

If 
𝐴
A has 
𝑛
n distinct eigenvalues, it is guaranteed to have 
𝑛
n linearly independent eigenvectors.
These eigenvectors form the columns of 
𝑉
V, enabling diagonalization.
If 
𝐴
A does not have 
𝑛
n distinct eigenvalues, it may or may not be diagonalizable, depending on the eigenvectors' linear independence.


Q4: Significance of the Spectral Theorem in Eigen-Decomposition
Spectral Theorem:
A symmetric matrix 
𝐴
A is diagonalizable by an orthogonal matrix 
𝑄->𝐴=𝑄Λ𝑄𝑇A=QΛQT,where 𝑄𝑇=𝑄−1 QT=Q−1.

Significance:

Ensures that real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.
Simplifies decomposition for applications like PCA.  


Q5: Finding Eigenvalues and Their Representation
Finding Eigenvalues:
Solve the characteristic equation 
det
(𝐴−𝜆𝐼)=0   
det(A−λI)=0.

Q6: 
Eigenvectors define directions in the vector space that remain unchanged under the transformation A, while eigenvalues scale these directions. Together, they encapsulate the matrix's geometric and structural properties.


Q7:
Eigenvectors: Represent directions along which the transformation stretches or compresses the space.
Eigenvalues: Indicate the amount of stretching (if λ>1) or compression (if
λ<1) along the eigenvector direction.
Example: For a 2D rotation matrix, eigenvectors align with axes of rotation, and eigenvalues define scaling in those directions.


Q8: 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing dimensionality by projecting data onto principal components.
Vibrations Analysis: Analyzing natural frequencies and modes of mechanical systems.
Quantum Mechanics: Diagonalizing Hamiltonians to find energy states.


Q9:
A matrix's eigenvalues are unique (up to multiplicity), but eigenvectors may vary due to scalar multiplication.
However, for a given eigenvalue, any scalar multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector.


Q10: 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Identifies directions of maximum variance, used for dimensionality reduction.
Spectral Clustering:
Utilizes eigenvectors of similarity matrices to find clusters in data.
Graph Analysis:
Eigenvalues of graph Laplacians reveal structural properties like connectivity and community detection.
